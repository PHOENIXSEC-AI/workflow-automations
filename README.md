# Workflow Automation

A modular and scalable workflow automation system built with Prefect, designed to orchestrate AI workflows data processing tasks with ease.

## üîç Overview

This project provides a framework for creating, managing, and monitoring automated workflows. It's built to be extensible, allowing for simple integration of new tools, data sources, and custom processes.

## üîÑ Workflows

<details>
<summary><strong>Repository Analysis Flow</strong> - Analyze and document code repositories</summary>
<br>

This workflow analyzes GitHub repositories, extracts key information, and generates documentation.

Still WIP, but it's usable

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/phoenixsec-workflow-automation.git

# Install uv package manager
pip install uv

# Install dependencies using uv
uv install .

# Create Docker network for Prefect
docker network create prefect-dev-network # Also used for development containers

# Start the infrastructure services
docker compose up -d
```

## üîë Prerequisites

The following API keys are required for full functionality:

```bash
# Required for AI-powered code analysis
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key_here

# Required for accessing private repositories
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here

# Optional for advanced logging and tracing
export LOGFIRE_API_KEY=your_logfire_key_here
```

You can also add these to your `.env` file:

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_key_here
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
LOGFIRE_API_KEY=your_logfire_key_here
```

Note:
- OPENROUTER_API_KEY is required for all workflows that use AI-powered analysis
- GITHUB_TOKEN is only required when analyzing private repositories
- LOGFIRE_API_KEY is optional, used for tracing and advanced logging capabilities

## üöÄ Getting Started

Run the repository analysis and documentation workflow:

```bash
doc-gen --urls https://github.com/nielstron/demjson3
```
Multiple URLs:
```bash
doc-gen --urls-file sample_repos.txt
```
Private repo(make sure `.env` is configured and has `GITHUB_TOKEN`):
```bash
doc-gen --urls https://github.com/your_org/private_repo --private
```
